# weather_api
A django rest API project where we can see an uploaded weather data 
User needs to register on the application first
After registeration and otp will be sent to that particular user for verification and he need to verify it through the verify OTP API
After that he can successfully log in on the application and start accessing the data
Unregistered user cannot access the weather data as he need JWT Authentication first
